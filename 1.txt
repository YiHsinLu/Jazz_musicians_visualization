Discussion

* 1. Update R shiny visualization
	+ add musicians search (zoom in)
	+ use Plotly for visualizing
* 2. distance vs affinity matrix
	+ not much different
	+ affinity puts single-value information together


To-do

* 1. R shiny version visualization
	+ weights tuning
* 2. Network polt by our data without tuning
* 3. Based on the paper proving 1-Jac(x,y) is a kind of distance method, we could use a similar progress on the new version of Jaccard
