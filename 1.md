Discussion

* 1. Explain why use the product of each value in two matrices for combination with Jaccard
	+ Jaccard: vector with many "0"
	+ Other method: vector without any "0"
	+ Mixed two kinds of methods
* 2. Data Matrices
	+ genre
	+ yearsActive

 	+ recordLabel
* 3. Main Plot



To-do

* 1. Data matrices
	+ genre
		- classes in PCA
		- color
	+ recordLabel
		- classes in PCA
		- color

* 2. Paperwork
	+ visualization method
		- PCA/MDS
		- t-SNE
	+ Plot
		- main plot: combined instrument, genre, recordLabel, yearsActive
		- weight on instrument
		- weight on genre
		- weight on recordLabel
		- weight on yearsActive
		- zoom-in for the main plot
